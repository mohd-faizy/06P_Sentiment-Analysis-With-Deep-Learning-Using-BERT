## __What is BERT?__

__Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)__ is a Transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google.BERT is a deeply bidirectional, unsupervised language representation, pre-trained using only a plain text corpus. Context-free models such as word2vec or GloVe generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, where BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word.

## What are some variants of BERT?

> BERT has inspired many variants: __RoBERTa, XLNet, MT-DNN, SpanBERT, VisualBERT, K-BERT, HUBERT__ and more. Some variants attempt to compress the model: __TinyBERT, ALERT, DistilBERT__ and more. We describe a few of the variants that outperform BERT in many tasks

> RoBERTa: Showed that the original BERT was undertrained. RoBERTa is trained longer, on more data; with bigger batches and longer sequences; without NSP; and dynamically changes the masking pattern.

> ALBERT: Uses parameter reduction techniques to yield a smaller model. To utilize inter-sentence coherence, ALBERT uses Sentence-Order Prediction (SOP) instead of NSP.
XLNet: Doesn't do masking but uses permutation to capture bidirectional context. It combines the best of denoising autoencoding of BERT and autoregressive language modelling of Transformer-XL.

> MT-DNN: Uses BERT with additional multi-task training on NLU tasks. Cross-task data leads to regularization and more general representations.

## __Dataset__
> We will use the [__SMILE Twitter DATASET__](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3187909.v2)

## __Objective__

:one: To Understand what __Sentiment Analysis__ is, and how to approach the problem from a neural network perspective.

:two: Loading in pretrained BERT with custom output layer.

:three: Train and evaluate finetuned BERT architecture on Sentiment Analysis.


## Finetuning BERT in PyTorch for sentiment analysis.

- __BERT__ is basically the advancement of the __RNNs__, as its able to Parallelize the Processing and Training. For __Example__ - In sentence we have to process each word sequentially, __BERT__ allow us to do the things in Parellel.
- __BERT__ is a large-scale transformer-based Language Model that can be finetuned for a variety of tasks.

![Embeddings](https://mengxinji.github.io/Blog/images/bert/embedding.jpg)

> We will be using the __Hugging Face Transformer library__ that provides a __high-level API__ to state-of-the-art transformer-based models such as __BERT, GPT2, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and many more__. The Hugging Face team also happens to maintain another highly efficient and super fast library for text tokenization called Tokenizers.

## __Specification__
    - Bidirectional: Bert is naturally bi-directional
    - Generalizable: Pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned easily for downstream NLp task.
    - High Performace: Fine-tuned BERT models beats state-of-art results for many NLP tasks.
    - Universal: Framework pre-trained on a large corpus of unlabelled text that includes the entire Wikipedia( 2,500 million words!) & Book Corpus (800 million words)
